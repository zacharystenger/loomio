# Loomio AngularJS Frontend
This is the beginnings of a document to introduce people to the
AngularJS parts of Loomio. It is assumed that you have the rails parts
of loomio running already.

# Installing Node
Install the latest version of node.js for your system. (Some of us quite like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))

# Installing Bower & Lineman

  `$ npm install -g bower`  
  `$ npm install -g lineman`

# Installing Dependencies
in the loomio folder  
  `$ cd lineman`  
  `$ npm install`  
  `$ bower install`

# Running
Run the rails development server and Private Pub
  (loomio) `$ rails s`  

For production environments only, run Private Pub (this is unnecessary for development)  
`$ rackup private_pub.ru -s thin -E production`


Then start lineman from the loomio/lineman folder  
`$ cd lineman`  
`$ lineman run`

# Browsing
- First go to the rails app at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) and sign in.  
- After logging in, visit [localhost:3000/angular](localhost:3000/angular) to enable the angular dashboard for your User.  
- After activating the angular interface, you can use the javascript app at [localhost:8000](localhost:8000)

# Unit Testing
We're going for high test coverage of our JS frontend here.
You can run the unit tests with

  `$ lineman spec`

# Integration testing
We're not using linemans default e2e testing stuff. Insted we're going for cucumber.js integration tests.


## Installing Protractor & Webdriver-manager
To run the integration tests, you'll need Protractor and Webdriver-manager

  `$ npm install protractor`  
  `$ webdriver-manager update --standalone`  

(NB: This will require a java development kit to function correctly, [go here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/) for more details on installing a JDK)

## Running e2e tests

To run the e2e tests, you need a bit of environment running. It's
probably easiest if you run these each in their own terminal window.

  From the loomio folder:  
  `$ rails s`

  From the loomio/lineman folder:  
  `$ lineman run`  
  `$ webdriver-manager start`  

  Then finally to run the tests:  
  `$ lineman grunt spec-e2e`

# -- Server env -- 

RACK_ENV=development  
APP_LOGO_PATH

### CANONICAL_HOST
Hostname of the loomio instance. For us it's "www.loomio.org"

### DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN
Groups can have subdomains rather than paths to locate them. ie: plainka.loomio.org rather than www.loomio.org/g/2423d23/palinka. Default subdomain is usually "www".

### DELAY_FAYE
When sending messages to the FAYE websocket server, use delayed job. This is a dumb hack incase the websocket server is down, so that that error does not break the user experience.

### DEVISE_SECRET
generate a secret with rake secret and use it here.

Should we try to send messages to the websocket server. IE: is the 1.0 interface live updating enabled? and have you setup your FAYE server?

FAYE_ENABLED  
FAYE_URL

Should all links be https? If so enable this and we'll force all traffic to be https
FORCE_SSL

If you are hosting www.loomio.org then enable this. the loomio marketing will show. You do not want to set this ever

SHOW_COMMERCIAL_PAGE  
SHOW_LOOMIO_ORG_MARKETING  

### Email setttings:
see config/environments/production.rb and http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration

SMTP_DOMAIN  
SMTP_PASSWORD  
SMTP_PORT  
SMTP_SERVER  
SMTP_USERNAME  

### REPLY_HOSTNAME
So that people can reply by email, you can setup a loomo-email-gateway box. This needs an address such as reply.loomio.org. We generate custom email addresses for custombit@ENV['REPLY_HOSTNAME'] so that you can reply by email.


### ALLOW_ROBOTS
Set to 1 if you want to allow robots (search engines) to crawl the public data of the site. In practice this controls the robots.txt file.
